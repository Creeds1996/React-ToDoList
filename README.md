# TO DO LIST

I create this to do list with React. It allows for adding, editing and deletion of tasks that are broken into three categories (Not Started, In Progress and Completed).

## Adding a task

Adding a task to the list is simple. Click the button labelled 'Add New Task' located on the top of the screen. This will open a modal which asks for a few inputs before adding the task, these are the name of the task and its current progress. Once these have been selected, simply press the 'Add Task' button to complete the action.

The Modal that appears can be closed via the button in the top right corner or by clicking the background.

## Editing a task

Editing a task is very similar to adding a task. Clicking the edit button that is associated with the task you wish to edit will open another modal. This modal will have the current name and progress that can be edited and confirmed with the 'Edit' button.

This modal can be closed with the exit button or clicking the background but it also offers the 'Cancel' button to discard any changes made.

## Deleting a task

Deleting a task follows very similar steps to the previous two. Clicking the 'Delete' button associated with the targeted task will open a confirmation modal allowing the user to confirm or disregard the deletion action.

This modal can be closed with the exit button or clicking the background but it also offers the 'No' button to disregard the deletion action.
